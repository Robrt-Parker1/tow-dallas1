                    <h2>Flatbed Towing</h2>
                    <p>Flatbed towing is a popular service because it allows for the safe transportation of vehicles that cannot be driven, such as in the case of accidents or severe mechanical failures. The vehicle is placed on a flatbed truck, which ensures that it is securely held in place and transported without causing further damage. This method is also ideal for luxury cars, motorcycles, and all-wheel-drive vehicles that should not be towed with traditional methods.</p>

                    <h2>Wheel-Lift Towing</h2>
                    <p>Wheel-lift towing uses a hydraulic lift to raise the front or rear wheels of a vehicle while the other set of wheels remains on the ground. This type of towing service is more economical and can be used for most passenger vehicles. It is ideal for quick tows, such as moving a car thatâ€™s blocking an entrance or has a flat tire.</p>

These vehicles require specialized equipment and powerful tow trucks to move them safely and efficiently. Heavy-duty towing often involves the use of larger flatbed tow trucks or a heavy-duty wrecker to ensure that the vehicle is handled properly.</p>
